# balancing rules

try for color balancing

For balancinc, we want a few things:
if we have less than 30 lands, import them all. If not, take all lands and blance by color.

Try and start with 23 cards per color, and randomly select them.
remove the rares and mythics from the count, so that they are always in the draft.
23 * 5 is 115

Then take the remaining slots and delegate them to lands, multicolors, and colorless first
same as above, keep all the rare and mythics first
Randomly select the rest
